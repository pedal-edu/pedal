Installation
============

You can install Pedal via PyPi, Github, or with special integrations.

PyPi

Compatibility
-------------

Pedal was designed to be a pure Python module, without any external
dependencies outside of the Python standard library.
The library is intended to be compatible with Python 3.7 and above (although
we have tried to be compatible with Python 3.6 when possible).
For full documentation on compatibility with the Python standard library, check :ref:`libraries`.

We have added a few *optional* dependencies that can improve the feedback
generated. All of these dependencies should work in almost any Python
environment, however. If they don't work, let us know!

You should refer to the :ref:`integrations` for more information on installing on specific platforms.
