Welcome to Pedal's documentation!
=================================

Pedal is a framework to analyze student's code and provide feedback.
Pedal is not only a collection of powerful program analysis tools, but
is also built to give a model for what Feedback should be.
Our goal is to elevate Feedback with Software Engineering and Instructional
Design practices, to make it a central part of your course's development
rather than an afterthought.
